What do we want accounting to do?  

Database Table:
Account, Member, Date, Transaction Type/Desc, Amount Change, New Balance

User Interface:
Enter all above information, then click "submit".  Transaction added to DB.

Features:
Entering account name facilitated by ajax-list of account names
Entering member name facilitated by ajax-list of members on account
Reviewing account status facilitated by ajax-display of recent transactions (and perhaps other account status issues?)

In Case of Errors:
On submit, data should be checked; if errors form should be given back with an Alert Box telling the error.


Close-Out:
(I don't understand close-out requirements.  Can someone clarify them here? --Paul)



What is the minimal code required to achieve this?

(remains to be seen)
