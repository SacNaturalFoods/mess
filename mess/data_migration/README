Data migration fills the MESS with data from the co-op's huge excel file.


HOW TO MIGRATE
Before you can migrate the data file, you'll have to 'Save As' file format
Excel 1997-2003 .xls.  (Sorry, that's all the xlrd module can read.)
Then find a secure way to transfer the data file to the server where you're
migrating it.  (psftp, perhaps?)

On the server, you'll want to do something like:
/var/www/mess# mv mess.db mess.db.backup
             # svn up
             # python manage.py syncdb

Now, before you take the next step, if you're on a publicly-accessible
server, you need to change the 'staff' password to be unguessable.
Log in to  http://yourmessserver/admin  as 'staff', and click the
'change password' link at the top-right.  Okay?  Now you can continue:

             # python data_migration/remove_allmembers.py
             # python data_migration/migrate.py ~/memberaccounts.xls


PRIVACY / SECURITY CONCERNS
Please be careful with the data.  In particular, don't email the data,
don't svn commit the data, and don't migrate the data on a publicly-
accessible host until you've made the 'staff' password(s) unguessable.
