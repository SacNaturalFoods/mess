** I. What is Django **
Django is a web programming framework built around Python.  It provides routines and classes (and probably other things) to help manage many aspects of a dynamic-database-driven website.  On the database side, Django deals with SQL calls so the programmer doesn't have to.  On the webserver side, Django does all kinds of things.

** II. What happens when I load http://mess.breaksalot.org/someurl ? **
Django keeps tables of URLs (in */url.py) telling which Template to use for each URL.  The template file (in /templates/*/*.html) is served to the browser.  However, the template file can include Python code, particularly pulling data from the database.  Code in the template is set off with {{ double braces }}.
